# Sales Prediction Model with Gradient Boosting

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data science project focused on building a sales prediction model using Gradient Boosting. The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualizations, and a machine learning model to predict `Total_Sales` based on a dataset with features such as `Retailer`, `Region`, `Product`, `Price_per_Unit`, `Units_Sold`, `Operating_Profit`, `Operating_Margin`, and `Sales_Method`. The model achieved an R² of 89% and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 974.83.

## Features
- **EDA**: In-depth analysis of sales data including outlier detection and data preprocessing.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive plots such as bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and time series to explore trends and relationships.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementation of a Gradient Boosting model with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics including MSE, MAE, R², and cross-validated R² scores = 89%.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Retailer`
- `Retailer_ID`
- `year`
- `month`
- `Region`
- `State`
- `City`
- `Product`
- `Price_per_Unit`
- `Units_Sold`
- `Total_Sales`
- `Operating_Profit`
- `Operating_Margin`
- `Sales_Method`
